# EscapeRoom-TravelAgency

Ongoing school project building an EscapeTheRoom puzzle on a Travel Agency themed website. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Basic Proposal below. More updates to follow.

Travel Agency – Themed Escape the Room
My Proposal:
	I will design a web page that looks like it belongs to a commercial travel agency. However, it will really be an “Escape the Room” game. Users will have to solve the puzzles on each page to unlock the puzzles on each of the following pages to open the final lock and download a certificate of completion. I will of course provide TAs with the solution to each puzzle and hopefully a code they can enter to automatically unlock the contents of each page.
	The website will consist of four main pages: Home Page, Promotions, About Us, Contact Us. Each page will have a menu at the top with links to each of the four pages and the company’s logo in the top left-hand corner. The footer will contain additional links, fake copyright and “powered by” information. The overall design will be simple, I am thinking a typical white back ground with a blue header and a dark-colored footer.

1) Home Page
The very top of the page will have a combination lock that reveals the combination to open the puzzles for the About Us page when the correct combination is entered. 
This page will have a picture carousel of various vacation locals.
Beneath the carousel will be several testimonials of people who have used the service. One of these testimonials will introduces the rules and scenario of the puzzle challenge. Others will contain clues to the page’s combination lock.
The bottom of the page will have a form for the user to submit feedback of their experience while playing.

2) About us
This page will display information about the company’s mission, vision, and history.
When the correct letters in the title “About Us” are pressed in the order specified when solving the Home Page, the puzzles in this page will unlock.
The very top of the page will have a combination lock that reveals the combination to open the puzzles for the Promotions page when the correct combination is entered. 
The left of the page will be a picture of the company’s founder. 
To the right will be a scrolling textbox containing a description of the company’s mission and history. It will also tell the user they should never be afraid to ask for help.
When the help button on the menu is pressed on this screen, the combination to the lock appears.

3) Promotions
This page will look like a travel agent's advertisement for an island vacation getaway. 
When the date in this page’s footer is set to the date specified when solving the About Us page, the puzzles on this page will unlock.
The center of the page will host an unordered list with several benefits, discounts, and promotions offered with the travel package.
The top-right of the page will have a calendar. When a day on the calendar is clicked, it will change between yellow and white.
When the title of the list is clicked, the items in the ordered list will shuffle their order into one of four different combinations. Each time it shuffles, however, one elements of the list will be different. These different messages will clue the user into making the yellow days in the calendar form an “X” shape. When this is done, it reveals the combination to the Contact Us page.

4) Contact Us
This page will have the company’s address and other contact information. It will also have what appears to be a form with Name, Email, Phone, etc. When the correct information is entered into these inputs (as instructed when solving the Promotions page) and the “Send” button is pressed, the message box will provide instructions on how to gather the final combination by looking at the other three pages as well as another webpage that can be accessed through a link. When this combination is entered into the combination lock at the top of this page, a link will appear to download the completion certificate.
