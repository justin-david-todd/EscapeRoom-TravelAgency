Hello,

This is a letter from your Evil Ex. As you may have noticed, I have locked you in your basement and changed the WiFi password. 

This Travel Agency website is now your only link to the outside world. They are currently having a contest where whoever can solve the puzzles on each of their pages wins a free vacation. I want the vacation, but am too lazy to actually do the puzzles. If you can solve the puzzles on each page and win the tickets for me, I will let you out.

If you don’t hurry I will have to pay for the vacation myself and leave you in the basement until I get back.

Don’t keep me waiting,

	Your Evil Ex.
